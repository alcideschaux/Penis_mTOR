### Description
In this section we evaluate the usefulness of `phos-S6 expression` for predicting outcome, including tumor recurrence, tumor progression, distant metastasis, overall mortality, and cancer-related mortality. The analyses include association tests (Fisher's exact test), survival analysis (Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test), unconditional binary logistic regression (for estimating odds ratios), and Cox's proportional hazards regression (for estimating hazard ratios). 

__Methodology:__ Immunohistochemical expression was categorized in 2 levels (low and high) using the `upper tertile` as the cutoff point.

```{r pS6_Levels}
marker.cut <- quantile(pS6, probs = 0.66, na.rm = TRUE)
marker <- ifelse(pS6 > marker.cut, c("High phos-S6"), c("Low phos-S6"))
marker <- factor(marker, levels = c("Low phos-S6", "High phos-S6"))
```

#### Immunohistochemical expression by H-scores

```{r pS6_DescriptiveH}
var <- pS6
t <- "H-score"
plot.numerical(var, label = t)
descriptive.numerical(var)
```

_Number of missing cases:_ `r sum(is.na(var))` cases.

***

#### Immunohistochemical expression by levels

```{r pS6_DescriptiveLevels}
var <- marker
t <- "Expression Levels"
plot.categorical(var, align = "v", xlab = t)
descriptive.categorical(var)
```

_Number of missing cases:_ `r sum(is.na(var))` cases.

### Association of Immunohistochemical Expression with Outcome
In this subsection we evaluate the association of levels of immunohistochemical expression with outcome (including tumor recurrence, tumor progression, distant metastasis, overall mortality, and cancer-related mortality) using the Fisher's exact test.

***

#### Tumor recurrence
```{r pS6_AssociationRecurrence}
outcome <- recurrence
t <- "Tumor Recurrence"
plot.categorical.group(marker, outcome, align = "v", xlab = t)
descriptive.categorical.group(marker, outcome)

```

***

#### Tumor progression
```{r pS6_AssociationProgression}
outcome <- progression
t <- "Tumor Progression"
plot.categorical.group(marker, outcome, align = "v", xlab = t)
descriptive.categorical.group(marker, outcome)

```

***

#### Distant metastasis
```{r pS6_AssociationDistantMetastasis}
outcome <- mets
t <- "Distant Metastasis"
plot.categorical.group(marker, outcome, align = "v", xlab = t)
descriptive.categorical.group(marker, outcome)

```

***

#### Overall mortality
```{r pS6_AssociationOverallMortality}
outcome <- dead
t <- "Overall Mortality"
plot.categorical.group(marker, outcome, align = "v", xlab = t)
descriptive.categorical.group(marker, outcome)

```

***

#### Cancer-related mortality
```{r pS6_AssociationCancerMortality}
outcome <- died.disease
t <- "Cancer-Related Mortality"
plot.categorical.group(marker, outcome, align = "v", xlab = t)
descriptive.categorical.group(marker, outcome)

```

***

### Survival Analysis by Immunohistochemical Expression
In this subsection we plot survival curves for levels of immunohistochemical expression by outcome (including tumor progression, distant metastasis, overall mortality, and cancer-related mortality) using the Kaplan-Meier method. Survival curves were compared using the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. Tumor recurrence was not included in the analysis due to the lack of events in the low phos-S6 group.

***

```{r pS6_SurvivalProgression, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 7}
# Tumor progression
outcome <- progression
fu <- date.progression.mo
t <- "Tumor Progression"
survival.plot(marker, fu, outcome, title = t)

```

***

```{r pS6_SurvivalDistantMetastasis, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 7}
# Distant metastasis
outcome <- mets
fu <- date.met.mo
t <- "Distant Metastasis"
survival.plot(marker, fu, outcome, title = t, ylim = c(0, 1.099))

```

***

```{r pS6_SurvivalOverallMortality, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 7}
# Overall mortality
outcome <- dead
fu <- fu.last.mo
t <- "Overall Mortality"
survival.plot(marker, fu, outcome, title = t)

```

***

```{r pS6_SurvivalCancerMortality, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 7}
# Cancer-related mortality
outcome <- died.disease
fu <- fu.last.mo
t <- "Cancer-Related Mortality"
survival.plot(marker, fu, outcome, title = t, ylim = c(0.4, 1.05))

```

### Unconditional Binary Logistic Regression
In this subsection we evaluate the usefulness of clinicopathologic features and immunohistochemical expression in predicting outcome (including tumor recurrence, tumor progression, distant metastasis, overall mortality, and cancer-related mortality) using unconditional binary logistic regression models. For each model we report the odds ratio (OR) with its 95% confidence intervals (lower and upper limits), raw P values, and P values adjusted using Hommel's correction.

```{r pS6_VariablesOR}
# Recoding new variables for regression models
older <- ifelse(age > median(age), c("Older"), c("Younger"))
caucasian <- ifelse(race == "Caucasian", c("Yes"), c("No"))
glans <- ifelse(site == "Glans", c("Yes"), c("No"))
lp <- ifelse(site == "Lamina Propria", c("Yes"), c("No"))
highgrade <- ifelse(grade == "Grade 3", c("Yes"), c("No"))

                   "Metastatic inguinal lymph nodes" = nodes,
                   "High phos-S6 levels" = marker

### Cox's Proportional Hazards Regression
In this subsection we evaluate the usefulness of clinicopathologic features and immunohistochemical expression in predicting outcome (including tumor recurrence, tumor progression, distant metastasis, overall mortality, and cancer-related mortality) using unadjusted Cox's proportional hazard regression models. For each model we report the hazard ratio (HR) with its 95% confidence intervals (lower and upper limits), raw P values, and P values adjusted using Hommel's correction.
